We run into difficulties in describing trends in an “American” criminal justice system because of Federalism. There is significant variation state by state. However, you see an expansion nationwide in the number of people being prosecuted, and the length of sentences.

In 2024, incarceration of a year or more will generally not have drug related offenses as the primary offense (as opposed to a weapons related offense). Those that ARE solely drug related are generally not going to be mere possession offenses -indeed, outside the 1980s, where was never really a time that this was the case. Rather, they are likely to be in prison for a trafficking related offense.

Over the last 20 years, rates of incarceration of young people has dropped precipitously, with other programming and community based solutions becoming far more common and a general belief that rehabilitation, which is a social goal generally that we try as a society to pursue, is particularly important in the case of young people.

Disparities in race are most common in states with actual racial population disparities. We can test this data in a variety of ways. For example, health data shows that people of all races use drugs. But, there are substantial disparities in prosecutions for drug offenses between different racial groups. Wisconsin rates in the top three states consistently in the racial disparities at sentencing. Black Americans make up six percent of Wisconsin population but forty percent of the prison population. There is also Compounded Social Disadvantage.

European criminal systems punish «The Other» far more severely than the United States, even if the US imprisons far more overall. In US, prosecutors are elected. Elsewhere, it is less political and more bureaucratic based on educational qualifications for prosecutorial work. This cuts both ways: the Progressive Prosecutor, more commonly in democrat jurisdiction, run on reform platforms including often decriminalizing certain behaviors by refusing to charge them. This is their Prosecutorial Discretion. This means elected prosecutors have been more punitive but also introduce a greater capacity for reform, which would likely be more fixed if these were bureaucratic roles.

Court cultures are important, and we see variations esp on crime rates, urban vs. rural, and race. Example: MKE juvenile court is very punitive, surprisingly so give. The amount of youth programming available in MKE vs other areas of the state.

In addition to the criminal law resources and institutions shared by Prof. Klingele, I also pay close attention to the Institute for Justice (https://www.youtube.com/user/InstituteForJustice) and Audit the Audit (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-0YpRpqgA5lPTpSQ5uo-Q). Both take a stance that is clearly and almost exclusively critical of the criminal justice system/s in America. As such, I'd encourage you to consume these resources with a healthy dose of skepticism.
